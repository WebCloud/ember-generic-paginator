# Generic Ember pagination

This is a regular ember-cli applicaiton, so all the goodies applies.

To use the generic pagination helper you must do the following steps.

### Extend your route from the PaginatedBase object

Also initiate your route calling _super with the intended model name to
be fetched and paginated.

```javascript
import PaginationBase from '../pagination-base';

export default PaginationBase.extend({
  init: function(){
    this._super('myModelName');
  }
  // continuation of your route
});
```

Note that with that you will not need to create the `model` hook yourself, but
if you need to extend it for some reason just call _super and receive the return of that.
Like so:

```javascript
  model: function(){
    myModel = this._super();
    // my extra logic

    return myModel;
  }
```

### Use the Paginated mixin in your controller

Also, create the total computed property for total, to be used to calculate the
total number of pages for your model data.

```javascript
import Paginated from '../../mixins/paginated';

export default Ember.ArrayController.extend(Paginated, {
  total: function(){
    return this.store.metadataFor('yourModelName').total;
  }.property('model'),
  // continuation of your controller
});
```
